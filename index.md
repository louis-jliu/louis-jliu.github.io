## About Me

Hi. I'm Louis (Jǐnruì).

I am currently a 2nd-year Ph.D. student of the [Physiology, Biophysics and Systems Biology Program](https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/programs/physiology-biophysics-systems-biology-1) at Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences in New York City, co-mentored by [Dr. Christina Leslie](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/christina-leslie) and [Dr. Kushal Dey](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/kushal-dey) from Sloan Kettering Institute. My current research interests lie in machine learning and statistical applications in genetics and genomics.

Prior to Cornell, I worked as a Senior Associate Scientist in a biotechnology company focusing on molecular data analysis for therapeutic discoveries and translational studies. I received my master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University emphasizing on bioinformatics research under [Dr. Carlo Colantuoni](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/carlo-colantuoni) and [Dr. Brian Caffo](https://sites.google.com/view/bcaffo/home). I received dual bachelor's degrees in Bioengineering from University of Missouri and East China University of Science and Technology.
