## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Physiology, Biophysics and Systems Biology Program at Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences and conducting research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Prior to Cornell, I worked as a Senior Associate Scientist in a biotech company. I received my master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University and my bachelor's degree in Bioengineering from University of Missouri.

My research interests include algorithmic method development and computational analysis of high-throughput experimental data to address questions related to immunology and oncology.
